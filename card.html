				<p> It is a myth that dogs are color blind. They can actually see in color, just not as vividly as humans. It is akin to our vision at dusk. Dogs do have better low-light vision than humans because of a special light-reflecting layer behind their retinas.Dogsâ€™ only sweat glands are between their paw pads.  A one year old dog is as physically mature as a 15 year old human.</p>
